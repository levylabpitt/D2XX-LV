# D2XX-LV
An improved LabVIEW interface for FTDI D2XX drivers.

# Description
[FTDI](https://ftdichip.com/) provides a set of [wrapper VIs](https://ftdichip.com/software-examples/code-examples/labview-examples/) to access FTD2XX.dll using LabVIEW. While these VIs are useful, they do not follow standard conventions such as having error terminals and uniform terminal layout.
- FTDI VIs are organized inside **D2XX.lvib**.
- Our VIs are organized in **D2XX-LV.lvlib**.

## Example:
**D2XX.lvlib:FT_Open_Device_By_Serial_Number.vi**

becomes:

**D2XX-LV.lvlib:Open Device (Serial Number).vi:**
